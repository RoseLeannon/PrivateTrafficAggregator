# Private Traffic Aggregator

üö¶ **Confidential Traffic Data Aggregation using Zama FHE Encryption**

A revolutionary blockchain-based system for collecting and analyzing traffic data while preserving privacy through Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).

## üåü Project Overview

Private Traffic Aggregator enables cities and transportation authorities to collect real-time traffic data without compromising individual privacy. Using Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology, sensitive traffic information is encrypted before being submitted to the blockchain, allowing for statistical analysis while keeping individual reports completely confidential.

## üîë Core Concepts

### FHE Contract Privacy Traffic Data Aggregation
- **Confidential Traffic Analysis**: All traffic reports are encrypted using FHE before being stored on-chain
- **Privacy-Preserving Analytics**: Statistical computations are performed on encrypted data without revealing individual contributions
- **Zero-Knowledge Reporting**: Traffic reporters can submit data without exposing their specific location or movement patterns
- **Aggregate Insights**: Transportation authorities receive valuable traffic insights while maintaining citizen privacy

### Key Features
- üîê **End-to-End Encryption**: Traffic data is encrypted from collection to analysis
- üìä **Real-Time Aggregation**: Continuous traffic monitoring with periodic cycle-based reporting
- üéØ **Regional Analysis**: Data organized by geographic regions for targeted traffic management
- üîç **Transparent Verification**: Blockchain-based system ensures data integrity and auditability
- üèõÔ∏è **Decentralized Governance**: Admin controls for region management and reporter authorization
